- 404: "/css/csslayer.css".  This appears to have been part of the BGA
  theme, but it looks like an empty file today on BGA (2024-03).

  From running a snippet I found quickly online, the following CSS
  classes appear to be undefined:

```
  0: "dj_ff124"
  1: "dj_contentbox"
  2: "finalbutton"
  3: "bgabutton"
  4: "bgabutton_blue"
  5: "bgabutton_gray"
  6: "socketButton"
  7: "bg_game_thinking"
  8: "id="
  9: "bg_game_score"
  10: "bg_game_debug_user"
  11: "dijitTooltipContents"
```
